Structuring Your Mod
====================

We'll look at how to organize your mod into different files and what those files should do.

Packaging
---------
Pick a unique package name. If you own a URL associated with your project, you can use it as your top level package. For example if you own "fakemods.com", you may `com.fakemods` as your top level package.

!!! important

    If you do not own a domain, do not use it for your top level package. It is perfectly acceptable to start your package with anything, such as your name/nickname, or the name of the mod.

After the top level package (if you have one) you append a unique name for your mod, such as `examplemod`. In our case it will end up as `com.fakemods.examplemod`.

The mod file
------------
Generally, we'll start with a file named after your mod, and put into your package. This is the *entry point* to your mod
and will contain some special indicators marking it as such.

What is @Mod?
-------------
This is an annotation indicating to the Forge Mod Loader that the class is a Mod entry point. It contains various metadata about the mod. It also designates the class that will receive @EventHandler events. More information can be found at... (Coming Soon)

You can find an example mod in the [Forge src download](http://files.minecraftforge.net/).

Keeping your code clean using sub-packages
------------------------------------------
Rather than clutter up a single class and package with everything, it is recommended you break your mod into subpackages.

A common subpackage strategy has packages for `common` and `client` code, which is code that can be run on server/client and client, respectively. Inside the `common` package would go things like Items, Blocks, and Tile Entities (which can each in turn be another subpackage). Things like GUIs and Renderers would go inside the `client` package.

!!! note

    This package style is only a suggestion, though it is a commonly used style. Feel free to use your own packaging system.

By keeping your code in clean subpackages, you can grow your mod much more organically.

Class naming schemes
--------------------
A common class naming scheme allows easier deciphering of what a class is, and also makes it easier for someone developing with your mod to find things.

For Example:

- An `Item` called `PowerRing` would be in an `item` package, with a class name of `ItemPowerRing`.
- A `Block` called `NotDirt` would be in a `block` package, with a class name of `BlockNotDirt`.
- Finally, a `TileEntity` for a block called `SuperChewer` would be a `tile` or `tileentity` package, with a classname of `TileSuperChewer`.

Prepending your class names with what *kind* of object they are makes it easier to figure out what a class is, or guess the class for an object.
