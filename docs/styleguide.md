Guide for contributing to this documentation
--------------------------------------------

This documentation is meant to be explanatory. Please explain how to do things, and break it down into reasonable chunks.
We have a wiki elsewhere that can capture more comprehensive code examples.

Our audience is anyone who wants to understand how to build a mod using Forge.

Please don't try to turn this documentation into a tutorial on Java Development - it is intended for people who understand how a Java class works, and other fundamental structures of Java.

Formatting

    Please use TWO SPACES to indent, not tabs.
